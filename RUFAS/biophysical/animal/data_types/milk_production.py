        The number of days the animal has been in milk production, (simulation days).
    days_born : int

        Whether the cow calves during the current daily routine. Because the milking update runs
        before the reproduction update that sets ``days_in_milk = 1``, this flag lets the milking
        update recognize the first day of a new lactation while ``days_in_milk`` is still 0.
