# RuFaS: Ruminant Farm Systems

**RuFaS** is an open-source, next-generation, whole-farm modeling environment that simulates dairy farm production and environmental impact. It is designed to support research, innovation, and sustainable decision-making in ruminant animal agriculture. 

---

### 🌍 Vision

A world where the continuous generation and sharing of knowledge about ruminant production systems [^note] empower understanding and decision making to achieve socio-economic well-being and environmental sustainability.
[^note]:  **RuFaS** is currently focused on dairy cattle production systems.


---

### 🎯 Mission

To develop, maintain, and share an open, modular simulation platform that connects scientific research with real world decision making. Equip scientists, farmers, and other stakeholders with tools to understand, evaluate, and improve the environmental, economic, and social outcomes of ruminant farming systems by integrating transparent models, diverse data, and collaborative contributions.
 

---

### 🧪 Scientific Foundation

RuFaS is grounded in peer-reviewed science and collaborative development. It is maintained by a diverse community of researchers, developers, and stakeholders committed to transparency, reproducibility, and continuous improvement.

---

### ♟️ Strategy

The strategic direction of RuFaS, including its vision, mission, strategic pillars, values, and operating principles, is described in [Strategy.md](Strategy.md).

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Python 3.12 or 3.13** - Make sure you have one of these versions installed on your system.
2. **Set up a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate on Mac/Linux or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```
3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install .
```
4. **Enable output display** - Navigate to `output/output_filters/` and rename `_csv_all_variables.txt` → `csv_all_variables.txt` (remove the leading underscore).
5. **Run RuFaS**
```bash
python main.py
```
6. **Learn more** if you have further questions read through the documentation on our [GitHub Pages site](https://ruminantfarmsystems.github.io/RuFaS/) or watch our [onboarding video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqq6i4QOoueR-a2mxVX3Gc78s1wvTRfr1).
7. **RuFaS Brasil (Hemisfério Sul e Regionalização)** - Consulte o [Guia de Uso do RuFaS Brasil](docs/usage_brasil.md) para detalhes sobre configuração de latitude negativa, códigos IBGE e parametrização nacional.
